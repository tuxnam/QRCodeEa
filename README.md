This program detects attempt of email quishing using Azure Computer vision. 
The programâ€™s goal is to connect to Exchange through Graph API, and analyze emails in a mailbox, a list of mailboxes or resulting from a filter query. All emails with attachments are filtered out to keep only images content-types. Resulting attachments are downloaded, send to a Computer Vision prediction model built in Azure, and based on the results (probability threshold defined in a configuration file), defined as suspicious or not. Suspicious attachments are further decoded by a QRCode library and the resulting URL is added to the resulting analysis. The program outputs a .csv file with all the emails analyzed which contains a potentially malicious QR Code.

Examples:

   --searchFilter <search_filter>  Exchange search filter - Resultset will be analyzed by QRCodeEater for Quishing matches (optional) - Format: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/search-query-parameter?tabs=http#using-search-on-message-collections

       QRCodeEater.exe --searchFilter "(from/emailAddress/address) eq 'ceo@mycompany.com'"
